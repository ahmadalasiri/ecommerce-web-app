# Architecture üèóÔ∏è

The backend follows a modular, scalable, and maintainable architecture, Express.js, and MongoDB. The architecture is designed to ensure code reusability, separation of concerns, and scalability to accommodate future growth and changes in the application's requirements.

## Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern üåê

The backend architecture of `ecommerce` follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, which divides the application into three main components:

-   `Models`: Represents the data structure of the application, interacts with the database using Mongoose, and defines the schema for each resource.
-   `Controllers`: Processes incoming requests, interacts with services, and returns responses to clients.
-   `Routes`: Defines the API endpoints, maps HTTP methods to controller actions, and provides a standardized interface for clients to interact with the application.

## Database Schema üìä

The database used for `ecommerce` is MongoDB, a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format.

The database schema for `ecommerce` consists of the following collections:

-   `Users`: Stores user information such as name, email, password, and order history.
-   `Products`: Stores product information such as name, price, description, images, and seller details.
-   `Orders`: Stores order information such as customer details, product details, order status, and payment details.
-   `Reviews`: Stores review information such as product ID, customer ID, rating, comment, and timestamps.
-   `Carts`: Stores cart information such as user ID, product ID, quantity, and total cart price.
-   `Categories`: Stores category information such as name, description, and subcategories.
-   `Subcategories`: Stores subcategory information such as name, description, and parent category.
-   `Brands`: Stores brand information such as name, description, and products.
-   `Coupons`: Stores coupon information such as name, expiration date, discount amount, and usage limit.

## RESTful API Design üìê

The API design for `ecommerce` follows RESTful principles, with clear and predictable URL structures, HTTP methods, and status codes. The API endpoints are organized into resource-based routes, with each route corresponding to a specific resource or entity in the system. The API design includes the following key features:

<!-- See [Database Schema](MongoDB-schema-visualization.md) file for more details. -->

-   `Resource-Based Routes`: Organizes API endpoints into resource-based routes such as /users, /products, and /orders.
-   `CRUD Operations`: Implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for all resources using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
-   `Pagination and Filtering`: Supports pagination and filtering for listing resources.
-   `Search and Sorting`: Allows users to search for resources based on keywords, categories, and other criteria, enhancing resource discovery.
-   `Error Handling`: Provides informative error messages, status codes, and error responses to help clients understand and handle errors effectively.

## Modular Structure üß©

-   **Controllers**: Handle incoming requests, process data, and send responses to clients.
-   **Models**: Define data structures and schemas for MongoDB collections using Mongoose.
-   **Routes**: Define API endpoints, route requests to controllers, and handle HTTP methods.
-   **Middleware**: Implement custom middleware functions for authentication, validation, error handling, etc.
-   **Exceptions**: Define custom exception classes to handle errors and exceptions in the application.
-   **Utils**: Contain utility functions, helper classes, and third-party integrations to assist with common tasks.
-   **DB**: Contain data access objects (DAOs) to interact with the MongoDB database.
-   **Docs**: Define Swagger documentation files for API endpoints and models.

## Error Handling üö®

The backend architecture of `ecommerce` includes a robust error handling mechanism to catch and handle exceptions gracefully, providing informative error messages, status codes, and error responses to clients. The error handling mechanism includes the following key features:

-   `Custom Exceptions`: Defines custom exception classes to handle errors and exceptions in the application, providing detailed error messages and status codes.
-   `Error Middleware`: Implements error middleware functions to catch and handle exceptions, log errors, and send error responses to clients.
-   `Global Error Handling`: Centralizes error handling logic in a global error handler middleware to ensure consistent error responses across the application.
-   `Error Logging`: Logs errors and exceptions to track application behavior, monitor performance, and debug issues effectively.
-   `Error Response Format`: Standardizes error responses with a consistent format, including status codes, error messages, error details, and stack traces.

# API Documentation üìñ

<!-- The API documentation for `ecommerce` is available using [Swagger UI](https://server.ecommerce.tech/api-docs). -->

I will be updating the Swagger UI link soon.
